However: - Children of the down node do not have access to new symbols (i.e. passthrough symbols) that are generated by the GroupId. These must be translated. - We cannot pass through preferences for symbols that are modified by GroupId (i.e. the set difference of the distinct and common grouping columns). These must be removed.
