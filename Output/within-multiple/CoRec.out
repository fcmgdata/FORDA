At the time, the maximum possible number of threads possible were chosen.

Add millisecond parser for dynamic date fields mapped from "yyyy/MM/dd" Dynamic date fields mapped from dates of the form "yyyy-MM-dd" automatically receive the millisecond <unk> epoch_millis as an alternative parsing format. However, dynamic date fields mapped from dates of the form "yyyy/MM/dd" do not. This is a bug since the migration documentation currently specifies that a dynamically added date field, by default, includes the epoch_millis format. This commit adds epoch_millis as an alternative parser to dynamic date fields mapped from dates of the form "yyyy/MM/dd". Closes #12873

Such sharing may provide useful optimizations in program runtime or footprint. Note that this inspection does not report zero-length arrays allocated as static final fields, as it is assumed that those arrays are being used to implement array sharing.
